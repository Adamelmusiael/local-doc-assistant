Manual Testing Queries for Dynamic Chunk Selection

This file contains 10 carefully crafted queries to test different complexity levels
and validate that the dynamic chunk selection is working correctly.

Expected Chunk Counts:
- Simple (3-5 chunks): Basic factual questions
- Medium (8-12 chunks): Process questions, feature lists
- Complex (15-18 chunks): Analysis, methodology explanations  
- Comprehensive (20-25 chunks): Full summaries, complete overviews
